To answer these questions in aquatic systems, the Gulf Coastal Plains & 
Ozarks (GCPO) Landscape Conservation Cooperative needs bring together 
the elements of conservation decisions into a framework that allows 
adaptive learning and strategic action. The decision elements likely 
include: a clearly stated set of goals; an assessment of baseline 
conditions; current and future stressors; a set of potential management 
actions; and formal linkages between conditions, actions and biological 
responses (i.e. a model). 

The general approach of this project will be to coordinate with GCPO 
staff and partners to prototype an adaptive decision framework that 
incorporates potential future changes into current aquatic management 
decisions. Key to development of this prototype will be identification 
of a core technical advisory team made up of a mix of planners, managers 
and researchers to represent the diversity of stakeholders within the 
GCPO. 




The Gulf Coastal Plains & Ozarks (GCPO) Landscape Conservation Cooperative needs to bring together the elements of conservation decisions into a framework that allows adaptive learning and strategic action. A structured decision-making (SDM) process has been proposed as the method to address conservation planning questions in aquatic systems. An engaged stakeholder and decision making group (e.g., managers, planners, researchers) increases the likelihood of success of SDM approaches. 

Therefore we to solicit the input and expertise of the Adaptation Science Management Team (ASMT) to identify potential species of inland freshwater aquatic system systems listed in the Integrated Science Agenda (High, Medium-low, Mainstem "Big" streams and rivers) to develop a SDM approach to landscape-scale conservation. In particular, we are interested in aquatic species you may be aware of within the GCPO with stakeholder interest, a large spatial scale, and may be subject to an existing problem of interest. 

In short, we are in the planning stages for this project and are soliciting input and guidance from the ASMT to identify potential aquatic species and problems in the GCPO where a SDM approach might be successful. 


Thanks in advance for your input,

EAST AND WEST GULF COASTAL PLAINS
Freshwater Aquatic: Medium-low gradient streams and rivers
General description of desired ecological state: Medium-sized streams and rivers characterized by intact
channel morphologies that support riffles and pools and a complex of physical structure (woody debris,
leaf litter, and substrate types). Flows are relatively steady, with infrequent periods of low water
quantity and high water temperatures.
Amount: Maintain current river miles
Configuration: Connectedness that ensures accessibility of habitats and resources within a watershed
Lateral connectedness: functional connectivity to floodplain habitats
Linear connectedness: functional connectivity of a stream network
Condition: Quality
Temperature – below critical threshold
Quantity
Adequate magnitude with limited frequency of low flows conditions
Structure
Intact channel morphologies
Natural riffle-pool sequences
Meandering channels with natural sinuosity
High physical structure complexity
High amounts of small woody debris
Adequate amounts of large woody debris
Diversity of substrates, including numerous gravel beds and sandbars 

OZARK HIGHLANDS
Freshwater Aquatic: High gradient streams and rivers
General description of desired ecological state: Small springs, runs, and headwaters characterized by
clear, clean, and relatively cold water in largely undisturbed forest settings.
Amount: Maintain current river miles
Configuration: Landscape context: watersheds should be >75% forested, with <10% impervious cover
Intact riparian corridors consisting primarily of hardwoods within 30 m buffer of stream
Interconnected stream systems
Condition: Water Quality
High water quality – minimal contaminants and nutrients
Temperatures – low
DO – high
Sediment – minimal
Water Quantity
Natural flow regimes maintained
Groundwater flow regime: low flow variability, low peak flows, low
frequency of low flows
Runoff Flow regime: moderate flow variability, moderate peak flows,
moderate frequency of low flows
Intermittent flow regime: high flow varaibiliy high peak flows, high
frequency of lows flows
Structure
Abundant leaf litter
Variety of substrates – gravel to boulders
