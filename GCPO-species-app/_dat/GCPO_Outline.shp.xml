			<abstract>These geographic constructs for the GCPO LCC are derived mostly from the BCR boundaries (Important to formulating JV boundaries) within the GCPO except the Gulf Coastal Area. The Gulf Coastal area was defined on the west by the new MAV boundary and on the north with the Gulf Coast JV/ Southern Coastal Plain Omernik Level 3 ecoregion. The coastline was modified to better match geographic features by Gulf Coast JV and GCPO LCC staff for this revision. Landscape conservation cooperatives (LCCs) are conservation-science partnerships between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and other federal agencies, states, tribes, NGOs, universities and stakeholders within a geographically defined area. They inform resource management decisions to address national-scale stressors-including habitat fragmentation, genetic isolation, spread of invasive species, and water scarcity-all of which are accelerated by climate change.</abstract>
			<purpose>LCCs provide scientific and technical support for conservation at "landscape" scales-the entire range of an identified priority species or groups of species. They support biological planning, conservation design, prioritizing and coordinating research, and designing species inventory and monitoring programs. LCCs also have a role in helping partners identify common goals and priorities to target the right science in the right places for efficient and effective conservation. By functioning as network of interdependent units rather than independent entities, LCC partnerships can accomplish a conservation mission no single agency or organization can accomplish alone.</purpose>
			<supplinf>For further information go to http://www.fws.gov/science/shc/lcc.html Collectively, LCCs will comprise a seamless national network supporting landscapes capable of sustaining abundant, diverse and healthy populations of fish, wildlife and plants. They will provide a strong link between science and conservation delivery without duplicating existing partnerships or creating burdensome and unnecessary bureaucracy. Science-based recommendations and decision-support tools produced by LCCs will be readily transferable to field offices that implement on-the-ground actions. Rather than create a new conservation infrastructure from the ground up, LCCs build upon explicit biological management priorities and objectives, and science available from existing partnerships, such as fish habitat partnerships, migratory bird joint ventures and flyway councils, as well as species- and geographic-based partnerships. LCCs support adaptive resource management by evaluating implementation of conservation strategies, maintaining and sharing information and data, and improving products as new information becomes available. Shared data platforms serve multiple purposes, including the collaborative development of population/habitat models under alternative climate scenarios to inform spatially explicit decision support for all partners. Decision-support systems and products developed by LCCs not only help determine the most effective conservation actions to support shared priorities, but also provide tools to compare and contrast the implications of management alternatives. In the face of accelerated climate change and other 21st-century conservation challenges, LCCs will regularly evaluate the effectiveness of scientific information and conservation actions and support necessary adjustments as new information becomes available. This iterative process of information sharing will help scientists and resource managers deal with uncertainties on the landscape and provide tools to compare and contrast the implications of management alternatives. LCCs were created from Geographic Areas. See http://www.fws.gov/science/shc/index.html for further information. This layer was created through a union of the Bird Conservation Region (BCR)layer and the Freshwater Ecoregions layer (FEOW). The purpose of this union was to retrieve some of the linework and attributes from the FEOW layer. Some linework from the FEOW layer was used to split some BCRs in order to accommodate high priority aquatic areas. It was also decided to union in the "Mid Atlantic" Hydrographic Unit Code (HUC) Region (Level 2) into this dataset so we could use the actual topographic boundary between the Mid-Atlantic Region (including the James and Chesapeake) from the South-Atlantic Gulf Region (including the Chowan-Roanoake) to split the Atlantic coast area. This was used instead of the FEOW boundary in this area because it diverged from the topographic boundary. After the edits were made by the mapping sub-group, this layer had the multi-part to single-part tool run on it and all polygons that had a BCR = 0 were deleted. These polygons were either the sliver polygons that were created where the FEOW and the BCR coast lines differed or FEOW polygons from areas not in North America. This was done to clean up the dataset. It also allowed the Team to select and classify the many small island polygons along the coast that were accidentally dropped out during the quick group editing process. “Gulf Coast Prairie” was updated to extend further east, Sept. 16, 2009. Names for several geographic areas were changed. “Insular Pacific-Hawaii” became “Pacific Islands,”” Northern Great Plains” became “Plains and Prairie Potholes,”” Northern Rockies” became “Great Northern” to comply more closely with LCC names. Changed Oct 7, 2009. The Geographic Area "South Pacific" was changed to "California"; "Northern Interior Forest" was changed to "Northwestern Interior Forest" and "Northern Atlantic" was changed to "North Atlantic". The “Pacific Islands” area was enlarged to include the new area identified by the regional climate change group. All edits were vetted through the FWS National Climate Team. November 12, 2009. Changes in geographic area names have been approved by LCC Coordinators Teresa Woods (“Eastern Tallgrass Prairie” is now “Eastern Tallgrass Prairie and Big Rivers”), Bob Ford (“South Florida” is now “Peninsular Florida”), Kathy Granillo (“Southern Great Plains” is now “Great Plains”) and Laverne Smith (“Northern Alaska” is now “Arctic”) on December 7, 2009. "Gulf Coast Plain and Ozarks" Geographic Area/LCC name changed to "Gulf Coastal Plains and Ozarks" (authorized by R4 Bill Uihlein - Interim Coordinator), "Arctic Plains and Mountains" Geographic Area name/LCC changed to "Arctic" (authorized by Phillip Martin - R7 Interim Coordinator), Dec 23, 2009. Data correction - added “Great Lakes” area to “Upper Midwest and Great Lakes” geographic area (authorized by Dan Ash (Science Advisor), John Wenburg (Acting Deputy Science Advisor) and Teresa Woods (R3 Interim LCC Coordinator)), Jan 6, 2010. Changed “Arctic” LCC to include entire Arctic Geographic Area (authorized by LaVerne Smith (R7 Science Applications ARD), Phillip Martin (R7 Interim LCC Coordinator), and John Wenburg (Acting Deputy Science Advisor)). Removed “Upper Midwest and Great Lakes” LCC. Combined Geographic Areas and LCC dataset into one layer of information and removed references to those LCCs that have FWS operational plans to make the datasets more generic and to conform to the current maps on the FWS and DOI websites (authorized by Chris Lett, John Wenburg, and David Eisenhauer, April 15, 2010.)</supplinf>
