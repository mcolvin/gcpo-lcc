2018113-SSA-FIT meeting

* 2010 was the first meeting

* Objective 
    * quality in volume
    * consistency
    * one last one didn't catch
* Quality. As capacity increases we can get a higher quality product. Tools
and techniques can help bend the curve and get higher quality of the SSAs.

* Integrating adaptive potential into ESA decisions
    * Representation is the adaptive capacity of the species (persist)
    * 3 mechanisms 1) movement, 2 phynotypic plasticity, 3) genetically based
    adaptation to environmental changes
    * Use proxies for AC in SSAs (presences across gradients, diversity of behavior or
    phynotypic variation across species)
    * What determines AC. Amount of heritable within and among population in fitness
    related traits (e.g., temperature tolerance).
    * Nice flow chart of listing and recover process under ESA (maybe get ahold of?
    or see Smith et al 2018)
    * To do SNPs it looks like 100k or more and a couple of years
    * Steps after initiating SSA
        1. Collect, review and synthesize existing information
        2. determine entity for assessment
        3. Assess current condition of species habitat and demographics and probable
        explanations for past and ongoing changes in abundance and distribution,
        determine conservation need
        4. Assess species likely response to probable future scenarios of environmental
        conditions and conservation efforts
        5. Use results of assessment to determine if species meets definition of threatened
        or endangered weight uncertainty and decision error
    * Principle of representation and loss and risk, white paper on how to talk about
    in and how much does representation really matter?
    * Good point to think about what information is needed and whether it can change
    status. 
* Ryan-Incorporating climate science into SSAs
    * Key messages
        * climate model represent the best available science
        * climate models are most useful for risk assessment when species climate
        sensitivity is well understood
        * Access, using, interpreting model output can be complicated
    * 2 types of downscaling, dynamic and statistical-GCM are still too coarse
    to do fine scale climate
        * Dynamic-feeds a high resolution small scale model allows the user to 
        look at mechanisms-still requires massive computing (super computing)
        * Statistical (empirical model) - build a statistical relationship with 
        historical data and projections, can be done on a laptop, issues are that
        it is generally limited to precipitation and temperature and assumes the historical relationsip
        is valid into the future.
* Brad 
* SSAs take ~18 months    
    
  
* Razorback sucker was a good example of representation and redundancy
    * Species level and describe species level 
    * Described units
    * Unclear what the species actually needs (used to be versus current distro)
    * Concluded representation was similar to what was in the past
    * Future-3 of 4 extirpate, lose southern adaptability
    * Thinking about loss of adaptive capacity
    * Lots of genetic information from stocking 
Ecoregions and ecotypes
* Delineate units, data varies 
* What does the loss of a representation mean in terms of risk, decision 
makers are not able to follow logic 
* What do you do with representation when populations are 10 miles apart
* representation is also capturing the breadth of environment.
* How do ecological settings influence adaptive capacity.
* Population and species level are interrelated. 
* How might effective population size change into the future
* You need to look at processes driving diversity and you want those processes
to remain in the future
* Narrow endemics-there may not be alot of variation or it may be artificial
* Looking a proxies 
* Challenges
    * Narrow endemics
    * Future Risk
* Solutions
    * Processes like genetic drift and gene flow for narrow endemics 
    * 
* Adaptive capacity units (units of unique sources of diversity) are
* Clarify the difference between adaptive capacity units and ecological contexts
* How many adaptive capacity units are needed in overall risk. 
* There is a disjunct in species recovery and population recovery
* What is the consequence of losing a representation unit to species persistance
 
    
    
## Redundancy

* you have to have a map-seen SSAs try to push through a report without maps
* no. of population in redundancy categories
* Redundancy north to south and tied back to number, e.g., 6 populations given
current and 4 under pessimistic scenarios. Done straight to the species level.
* Resilience categories map and how that changes with scenarios builds into redundancy
* Adaptive capacity unit (ACU). 
* Think about catastrophe as probabilistic... [AI]
* Lots of uncertainty as to difference between representation and redundancy
* Catastrophes are not coming in enough or not discussed enough.
    * catastropes need to be specified explicitly
* The story is getting lost need a good way to tell the SSA story
* Each population has a different catastrophe risk...
* In NCTC goes from population to species level in terms of 3Rs.
* SSAs are really focusing on executive summaries and synthesis chapters. 
* Fear of drawing conclusions --- e.g., I have 8 in high and 2 in low and that leads
to some unknown level of risk. 
* Maybe think about some 'risk scenarios' i.e., best case and worst case, thinks
are relative. Generate varying 'risk profiles'    

## Resiliency and Current Condition tables (low analytic ssa)
 
* Used widely and potential wrongly. 
* Candy darter is a good example 
    * what you could measure
    * used a field trip to calibrate the table
* Arkansas river shiner & peppered chub
    * Good support in literature
    * Lots of good support for categories
    * Tight tie with river distance and pelagic drift
* Resilience in general 
    * Coast skipper used a Bayes net
* Lots of information does not necessarily lead to better resiliency
    * Really think about the data you have. Easier if there is a data analyst.
* SSA 200-how to talk to modelers is a good class
* Resiliency goes awry when people get creative. Need to have
population abundance and growth rate in there, basic drivers of
resilience are initial abundance and growth rate. (assumes habitat
is going to drive resilience, but if you have no population then no
resiliency). 
    * Could use a proxy like occupancy but you need to make explicit
* Ratio of positive to overall surveys 
* Threats don't end up in a condition table 
* Criteria  (Probability of population or ACU persistence) not 
not at species level (You have some flexibility using this approach).
* If resiliency is probability of persistence over time. 
* Decision makers might be anchoring on the resiliency (FWS has
gotten good at resiliency --> dm keying in on it, easier to 
wrap their head around resiliency) 

SPR-significant proportion of the range (should go into the first step of SSA?).
ARD-Assistant Regional Director

Risk of loss of genetic/adaptive capacity (blob that is out of core and maybe in 
poor shape that hinders recovery. 

Section 7 has a dual need for an SSA, incident take on a
individual take statement. 
Open standards of threats, and so on. 

## Cause and effect analysis

* use cause and effect tables, magnitude scale and scope. 
* need to have a good influence diagram 
* Razorback sucker use table to filter through threats to look
at individual 
* Whitetail prairie dog- do an analysis of stressor and effects population
level resiliency. Model, cause and effect table, and paragraph.
* does a cause and effect table be necessary for an SSA?
* Elevator SSA presentation is needed. 
* Skiff Milkveg was a good SSA but the executive summary was poor
* The bucket of threats is important to DMs
* Cause and effect table needs to link current and future scenarios
* Common theme of connecting the dots from current, cause and effect, and future.
